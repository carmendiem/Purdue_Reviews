# dining_court_app

A work in progress; this app will make improvements to the current Purdue Dining Court Menu app in a variety of ways.
  1. Users can review food items
  2. Food items will have pictures next to them (#1 & #2 let people know what they are actually eating before they select a dining court - oftentimes foods listed on the dining court app sound better than they actually are)
  3. Use SnapMap API to track the amount of people in dining courts
  4. Implement a better search and sorting feature
